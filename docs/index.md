Welcome to the documentation hub for Open Estate AI.  
Here you'll find guides, architecture, and usage examples for all our open-source real estate data projects.

## What is Open Estate AI?

Open Estate AI is an open-source initiative to make property data more accessible and actionable.  
We build tools and workflows for:

- Collecting real estate data from multiple sources
- Standardizing and storing data in a data lake
- Running scrapers and enrichment pipelines
- Integrating with MCP server and AI workflows
- Providing reusable templates for new scrapers and data tasks

- Check out our [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand how the pieces fit together.
- Browse [Guides](guides/scrapers.md) for step-by-step instructions on scrapers, data lake, and more.
