# Architecture

This page gives a simple overview of the Open Estate AI architecture and how the main pieces fit together.

## Key Components

- **Orchestrator**  
  The central service that receives user queries, manages agents, and coordinates all tasks and workflows.

- **Intent Classifier Agent**  
  An agent that takes a user’s query (free text) and converts it into structured intent and slots.
  - **Input:**  
    `{ request_id, text, user_context }`
  - **Output:**  
    `{ intent, slots, confidence, model_version }`
  - Example:  
    Input: "Find RERA-approved plots under 80 lakh near metro"  
    Output:  
    ```json
    {
      "intent": "find_listings",
      "slots": {
        "property_type": "plot",
        "max_price_inr": 8000000,
        "near": "metro",
        "goal": "investment",
        "rera_status": "approved"
      },
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "model_version": "intent-clf-v1.0.3"
    }
    ```

- **Planner Agent**  
  An agent that takes the intent and slots and builds a workflow (DAG) of tasks for other agents.
  - **Input:**  
    `{ request_id, intent, slots, user_context, policy_overrides }`
  - **Output:**  
    `{ dag: [ { task_id, task_type, payload_template, depends_on, timeout_ms, parallel_for } ], planner_meta }`
  - Example:  
    Input: intent and slots from above  
    Output:  
    ```json
    {
      "dag": [
        {
          "task_id": "t1_search",
          "task_type": "search_listings",
          "payload_template": {
            "property_type": "{{slots.property_type}}",
            "max_price_inr": "{{slots.max_price_inr}}",
            "near": "{{slots.near}}"
          },
          "depends_on": [],
          "timeout_ms": 5000
        },
        {
          "task_id": "t2_legal",
          "task_type": "legal_check",
          "payload_template": {
            "listing_ids": "{{t1_search.candidates.ids}}"
          },
          "depends_on": ["t1_search"],
          "timeout_ms": 8000,
          "parallel_for": "candidates"
        }
      ],
      "planner_meta": {
        "version": "planner-v1.1.0",
        "policy": "default"
      }
    }
    ```

- **Other Agents**  
  Specialized agents that perform tasks such as [searching listings](./agents/search-agent.md), [legal checks](./agents/legal-agent.md) , [valuation](./agents/valuation-agent.md), and [verification](./agents/verification-agent.md).  
  Each agent receives a task message, processes it, and returns a result.

- **Message Queue**  
  Used for communication between the Orchestrator and agents. Tasks and results are sent via topics (e.g., tasks.search, tasks.legal).

- **Audit & Metrics**  
  All actions, results, and provenance are logged for traceability and debugging.

## How a User Query is Handled

1. **User submits a query**  
   Example: "Find RERA-approved plots under ₹80 lakh near metro, good for investment."

2. **Intent Classification**  
   Orchestrator sends the query to the Intent Classifier Agent, which extracts intent and slots.

3. **Planning**  
   Orchestrator sends the intent and slots to the Planner Agent, which creates a DAG of tasks.

4. **Task Execution**  
   Orchestrator enqueues tasks to the message queue.  
   Agents pick up tasks, perform their work, and publish results.

5. **Aggregation & Guardrails**  
   Orchestrator collects results, runs checks (e.g., confidence, source verification), and composes the final answer.

6. **Response Delivery**  
   Orchestrator returns results to the user. If some tasks are slow (like phone verification), it can return partial results and update later.

7. **Human Escalation**  
   If confidence is low or a guardrail fails, Orchestrator creates a human review ticket.

## Summary

Open Estate AI uses a modular, agent-based architecture to turn user queries into structured workflows.  
The Orchestrator coordinates the Intent Classifier Agent, Planner Agent, and other specialized agents to ensure reliable and traceable results.
