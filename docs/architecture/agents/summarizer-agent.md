# Summarizer Agent

## What it does

- Takes outputs from the Search, Legal, Valuation, and Verification Agents.
- Combines them into a clear, user-friendly response.
- Explains why a property is good or bad, highlights risks, and attaches supporting evidence (citations).

## How it fits in the system

- The Orchestrator waits until Search, Legal, Valuation, and Verification results are ready.
- The Orchestrator creates a summarize_response task and sends it to the Summarizer Agent.
- The Summarizer Agent collects these inputs (or references to them).
- It uses an LLM + RAG (retrieves supporting docs if needed) to generate a plain-text explanation.
- It attaches provenance so the system can prove each claim.
- The final summary goes back to the Results Queue, where the Orchestrator picks it up and runs Output Guardrails.
